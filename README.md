**Of course, protect the app at all layers of the OSI reference model.**

Please do not worry. You can create an SD card easily by app. (Now offering Windows10 version. Mac and Linux versions will be released soon.)

This is just an example of RDBOX functionality. You can easily control robots at multiple locations.  
Many other functions are available in RDBOX.

<img src="./images/prepare_by_you_of_rdbox.png" title="../images/prepare_by_you_of_rdbox.png" width=600px>

1.  Prepare RaspberryPi and AWS or Azure or PC. (Please see the [wiki](../../wiki) for details.)
2.  Please also refer to [the latest release notes.](https://github.com/rdbox-intec/rdbox/releases)
3.  **[If you just want to try RDBOX out, check out the Our Wiki page to give it a whirl](../../wiki). （←英語/日本語の二ヶ国語のマニュアルが用意されています。）**

## Supplementary information

-   Example) [Install VirtualBox](https://github.com/rdbox-intec/rdbox/wiki/setup-rdbox-hq-vb-1-install_tools-en)

    -   Continue to [Our Wiki page](https://github.com/rdbox-intec/rdbox/wiki/setup-rdbox-hq-vb-2-prepare_virtual_machine-en)

        ```bash
        $ mkdir ${HOME}/git

-   [One of our utilities, flashRDBOX, ](https://github.com/rdbox-intec/flashRDBOX)allows interactive dependency injection (DI) to RaspberryPi. There is no need for difficult operations.
-   If you own [TurtleBot3](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/), you can also experience the deployment of ROS applications.
-   Otherwise, you can learn the procedure for building development environment with RDBOX.

# Effect on you

# What you do

-   Run the Script on your Virtual machine ([VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)).
-   Burn the SDCARD Image for your [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).

# Features

Make your job easy with **3 features**.

## **1. Orchestrate all resources** running "ROS robots".

-   You will get a simpler and creative development experience than [deploying with traditional roslaunch](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch). Furthermore, it becomes easy to control a lot of groups of robots. 
-   Orchestrate ROS nodes on robots and conputer resources by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
    -   **Allow mixing of x86 and ARM architecture CPU.**
    -   k8s master will run on AWS EC2 or Azure VirtualMachine VirtualBox on your PC.
-   Connect with the robots and others by [Mesh Wi-Fi Network](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki).
-   Connect with the Clouds/On-Premise by [VPN Network](https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN_Stable).  
![RDBOX_SHOW.gif](./images/RDBOX_SHOW.gif "show")

## **2. Make It yourself!!**

-   The RDBOX Edge devices builds with Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+/4B.
-   There is no worry that the back port will be installed. (All source code and hardware are disclosed.)
-   Raspberry Pi provides you edge computing and Wi-Fi network and environmental sensors and more.
-   Provide assembly procedure and original SD card image.  
![parts_of_edge.jpeg](./images/parts_of_edge.jpeg "parts")

## **3. NETWORK CONNECT**

-   Easily set up a dedicated local area network for robots.
    -   Simply connect RDBOX in between the internet and your service robot. In one simple step, you can build a local area network and development environment. No knowledge of internet or networking is necessary.
-   Many network applications, including NTP, are offered with the product. Automate your network robot management.
-   All you need is a power source. Cover the whole movable range of mobile robots with a Wi-Fi network.

# Compared with other robotics platforms.

**3 Advantages** compared to competitor's "robot development platform".

## 1. The RDBOX Provides ALL layers (L1 to L7) of the OSI reference model.

-   Competitor's "robot development platform" does not support it. You may need to pay a great deal of money to a specialist for consultation.
    -   Providing access points via mesh Wi-Fi. The robot just connects to the access point.
    -   It is possible to get security measures such as VPN and firewall andmore..., and convenient functions such as network application.
## 2. The RDBOX can be made with general equipment.
-   You can start using it with the "laptop" and "Raspberry Pi3B / 3B + / 4B" you may already have.
## 3. The RDBOX take in the good points of other companies' robot development platforms.
-   It can be used by combining "simulator linkage" and "existing API service" that other companies are good at.
    -   Object Detection API
    -   Reinforcement learning by Gazebo.
    -   and more..

-   Robotics is a complex technology.
-   Therefore, the backbone of the engineer is different. Naturally, IT skills of each engineer are not constant.
-   The use of IT technology is essential to build a robot system that links various types of service robots and IoT devices.
## RDBOX (a IT infrastructure for ROS robots.) Boosts the productivity of engineers with various backbones.
-   for Engineer with various backbones.
    -   Create opportunities to experience "Advanced IT technologies".
-   for Advanced IT Engineer
    -   Provides easy customization and high affinity to existing modules. (like a ToolBOX)
-   for Robotics beginners
    -   Master the standard development process.(high productivity.)

## Roadmap

-   [x] Portable version
-   [x] Multipoint connection
-   [ ] Improved fault tolerance (multiple sites version)
-   [ ] App Market
-   [x] Multi-OS GUI SDWriter
-   [ ] aws and nvidia, cooperation
